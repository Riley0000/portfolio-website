<div class="about">
    Always a contemplator and now a professional writer, Riley takes every opportunity to savor pieces of the informational deluge we receive on a daily basis; to slow down and pick things apart with full attention.

From Ferndale, Michigan—near Detroit—Riley earned an undergraduate degree in Writing from Grand Valley State University and stepped into studies from web development and multi-level editing to creative non-fiction and magazine writing. They went on to receive a faculty-funded Writing Major Scholarship and a Distinction in Writing award upon graduation. In years since, Riley has gone to work in print and media publishing as well as in small, craft-focused businesses, utilizing their appreciation for effective communication and an adaptable, hands-on attitude that finds a home in small, creative teams.

Riley has had the joy of learning several skills from this approach to work, from screen printing and driving zambonis to grant writing, editing magazine editorials, and most recently, diving into the complex world of front-end web development. Besides work, Riley tries to lead a sustainable lifestyle and enjoys reading nature and climate focused non-fiction. Their favorite places on Earth are the Bay of Fundy's northern edge, Marquette, Michigan, and Copenhagen. They are a home-based aerial expressionist living in Chicago.

As an aspiring information professional in the archival and library sciences, Riley plans on utilizing all types of historical records at hand to help every type of person better grasp the intricacies of life, human wellness, and the natural world.
